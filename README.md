JScript library to bring familiar Node.js functions and more...

Love Node.js? Bored using ancient Microsoft batch files? ðŸ“¢ This library can solve this issue, and it doesn't need any external solution.

Currently has very limited functions, any contribution would be appreciated.

Tested on win XP sp2 (5) .. win 10.
